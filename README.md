# Project-TenZO
An open source discord bot that anyone can host (for now)
-----------
Project TenZO is a discord bot primarily coded by me, a 14 year old who barely knows how to code, so expect issues ay every corner.  
Its open source so if you know what you are doing you can host the bot yourself and fix the issues.  

About
-----------
I had the idea to start this project on November 20th, 2021 while trying to fix hacks for a website called blooket. So I got bored and started this, I have no idea if I will actually make a decently functioning discord bot but if you are reading this, then the bot had an issue running a command and it sent you here. (yeah sorry if that happens)  
As I right this I'm sitting on the toilet taking a poop being sad because my crush is lesbian.
